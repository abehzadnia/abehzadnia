      <description>Bayes Rule in the discrete form, which allows us to calculate the probability of an event A given event B. This is what is called a conditional probability, and we will be working with conditional probabilities a whole lot in this module and also in the remainder of this course. One example of a conditional probability is the false positive or false negative rate of a medical test.
\[P(A|B)= \frac{P(A\bigcap B)}{P(B)}\]</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bivariate analysis&lt;/strong&gt; explore the possible relationship between two variables&amp;rsquo; variability. In view of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;exploratory&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; focus of EDA, we should refrain from infering based on bivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Univariate analysis focuses on a unfolding the intrinsic statistics of a single variable at hand. This is done as the first step, before jumping into assessing the relationship between variables in our data set.

      <description>Probability function is the function of a random variable distribution, whose value provides the absolute or relative likelihood of the value of the random variable in the sample.
Depending on the type of our random variable, we can calculate:
Absolute likelihood for a discrete variableRelative likelihood for a continuous variableOn this page we will discuss:
Probability Mass FunctionProbability Density FunctionPopular PMFs and PDFsProbability Mass FunctionDiscrete random variables have discrete and countable values.</description>

      <description>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to data analysis that employs tools of descriptive statistics in order to dissect the data. the term exploratory data analysis was coind by John W. Tukey in the 70s.
EDA is a philosophy rather than being statistical technique, in which the statistician takes the role of a detective whose main goal is to unveil the underlying patterns. This is contrary to the classical statistician who acts as a judge instaed.</description>

      <description>Probability distributions demonstrate the probability of an event. When dealing with discrete data, probability mass function of the event can come from various distributions. The most important discrete probability distributions are the Bernoulli, Binomial and Poisson.
Bernoulli distributionThe most widely known unknown discrete probability distribution is the Bernoulli distribution.
Named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the Bernoulli distribution is the probability distribution of the outcome of a single experiment with two possible outcomes.</description>
